## 1. Project Overview

In this project, I tackled the challenge of predicting housing prices in Ames, Iowa. The goal was to build a robust regression model by performing in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA), comprehensive feature engineering, and model tuning.

## 2. The Data

The dataset contained 79 explanatory variables describing almost every aspect of residential homes.

## 3. My Process

- **Data Cleaning & EDA:** Identified and handled missing values, visualized feature distributions, and explored correlations.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new features from existing ones, such as `TotalSF` (total square footage), and transformed skewed features using a log transformation.
- **Modeling:** I tested several regression models, including Lasso, Ridge, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Evaluation:** The final model was evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the test set.

## 4. Results & Conclusion

The final Gradient Boosting model achieved an impressive RMSE of X, placing it in the top Y% of submissions for this type of problem. This project demonstrates strong skills in the end-to-end machine learning workflow.
