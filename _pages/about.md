## 👋 Hi, I’m Ernest Essel-Kaitoo

I’m a **data-driven researcher**, **machine learning enthusiast**, and **church leader** passionate about using technology, data, and faith-based leadership to impact lives positively. I currently serve as the **Men’s Ministry Leader at MHC**, where I guide men in spiritual growth and mentorship.

### 🎓 Academic & Research Background

I’m a **Ph.D. student** focusing on **missing data mechanisms and imputation methods** — particularly how different **distance metrics in K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** affect imputation performance under varying data conditions such as dimensionality and missingness.  

My recent research explores:
- Performance of **Mahalanobis, Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski, and Chebyshev distances** in KNN imputation.  
- Comparative efficiency of **Bayesian vs. Maximum Likelihood** estimation.  
- Effects of **sample size**, **intraclass correlation**, and **data noise** on model reliability.
